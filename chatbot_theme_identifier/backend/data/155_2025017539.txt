Abstract‚Äî In this paper, the loan-default risk has been 
calculated using machine learning. It suggests and compares 
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random 
Forest models according to their predictive performances on the 
"Bank Indessa" dataset [1]. The data set is completely 
preprocessed. In that process, all missing values are replaced 
with appropriate values and categorical variables are encoded. 
Among the tested models, the XGBoost model has been proved 
to give the most accurate and predictive performances. This 
paper highlights the efficiency of PFR models and the 
significance of feature engineering in enhancing model 
performance. It provides relevant insights into using ML 
models for Financial Risk Assessment, thereby making credit 
scoring systems faster and more precise[2]. 
Keywords‚Äîloan-default, Machine Learning Models, Feature 
Engineering 
I. Introduction 
As financial transactions and loan applications rapidly 
increase, predicting loan-default risk has become more 
critical than ever[3][4]. Accurate predictions enable financial 
institutions to implement effective risk management and 
informed decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) models 
have been utilised in this paper to estimate loan-default risk, 
offering a valuable tool for reducing prediction errors and 
aiding lenders in their decisions. Economic indicators like 
asset-to-liability ratios are key to understanding default risks, 
with data from sources like the World Bank providing crucial 
insights[5]. Improved prediction accuracy helps protect 
portfolios and fosters data-driven, sustainable financial 
practices[6][7]. 
A. Problem Statement 
The core focus of this paper was using machine learning 
techniques for the accurate prediction of loan-default. 
Therefore, the lender requires the ability to make high-
accuracy predictions in this regard to both avoid financial 
risks and automate the loan approval process. In this paper, 
we have provided various Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms and models to predict loan-default with better 
reliability so that financial institutions can lend with better 
judgement and lower risks. 
B. Importance and Significance of Study 
The  findings of this study offer a valuable tool for lenders. 
This research, therefore, would develop a very fundamental 
tool for the lenders, thereby reducing the loss within the 
business finances by improving risk assessment between loan 
applicants. 
This research thus contributes not only to enhancement in the 
ability to forecast risk but also toward understanding the role 
of machine learning in the financial decision-making process. 
From here, the findings may result in more robust practices 
in lending and hence support financial stability in the lending 
institutions. 
C. Organisation of Paper 
The literature review covers traditional methods of loan-
default research and the adoption of Machine Learning (ML) 
for assessment of credit risk. It emphasises the importance of 
feature engineering and data preprocessing in improving 

--- Page 2 ---
model performance, along with various metrics for 
evaluating models. Future research directions and the 
existing research gap are also highlighted. The methodology 
describes the design, data collection, preprocessing, model 
development, and evaluation metrics. The results are mainly 
on the analysis of the data, performance of the developed 
models, and visualisations that provide interpretations of the 
findings. In conclusion, the paper aims at summarising key 
findings and providing recommendations for future work. 
II. Literature Review 
Prediction of loan-default is critical in managing the credit 
risk. The lender can identify possible defaulters and avoid 
risks effectively when using accurate models. Advance 
machine learning has improved the capability of prediction 
by utilising large datasets and complex algorithms. The 
section puts into scrutiny conventional techniques along with 
ML approaches, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics 
utilised for prediction of loan-default. 
A. Conventional Approaches to Predicting Loan-
Defaults 
Conventional methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR) and 
linear discriminant analysis, discriminant analysis, remain 
commonly employed across much of the industry, largely 
because of their simplicity and ease of interpretation.. LR is 
popular, especially due to its use for credit scoring, for the 
application of binary classification but does not capture 
nonlinear relationships. Lacking these capabilities, its use 
remains important because of its simplicity, which is 
sometimes necessary for regulatory and business purposes 
[8]. 
B. Approaches to Machine Learning (ML) Models in 
Credit Risk Assessment 
Machine learning goes beyond classical approaches, offering 
strong models by the use of Gradient Boosting and Random 
Forest techniques. Random Forest is great at handling large 
data sets and identifies intricate interactions between 
variables, while the gradient boosting technique adjusts the 
errors sequentially in generating an enhanced variant. 
XGBoost is an optimised Gradient Boost. There is the 
possibility of handling missing data by regularisation, and yet 
Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks are strong 
but often thrashed by hyperparameters and computational 
costs [3][6][7]. 
C. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing 
Feature engineering improves model performance by 
introducing new features such as financial ratios (income-to-
loan, balance-to-credit, and debt-to-income ratios) and 
polynomial features to reveal nonlinear relationships [10]. 
Preparing the data‚Äîsuch as scaling features, managing 
missing values, and dealing with imbalanced classes" 
through methods like the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique ‚Äî is essential for proper model training [11][12] 
D. Assessment of Performance Metrics 
Model performance is assessed using Accuracy, Precision, 
Recall, and F1 Score. While accuracy gives an overall view, 
Precision and Recall are more informative for imbalanced 
datasets. The Confusion Matrix provides detailed error 
analysis, and cross-validation ensures robustness by testing 
models on various data subsets [11]. 
E. Future Directions in loan-default Prediction 
Future research will focus on investigating advanced deep 
learning methods like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture 
sequential data and periodic trends [7]. Ensemble stacking 
and integration of alternative sources like social media 
activity would further help improve predictions [13]. Model 
accuracy and interpretability are still significant for 
regulatory trust [6]. 
F. Research Gap 
Although ML models appear to outshine traditional ones, 
areas of challenge persist in this field. These relate to feature 
engineering, data preprocessing, and model interpretability. 
Through ongoing research in these areas, issues on the 
dimensions are being addressed to further advance loan-
default prediction models. 
III. Methods of Research 
A. Research Design 
This study, like most ML pipelines, follows the data 
collection, 
preprocessing, 
model 
development, 
and 
evaluation pipeline (See Fig. 1). The Kaggle dataset [1] is 
obtained, with information that contains crucial aspects 
concerning the background of the borrower, his financial 
history, and loan details. Data preprocessing involved data 
cleaning, imputation of missing values, and one-hot encoding 
for proper training of the model. The purpose is to create 
various machine learning models and compare their 
predictiveness of loan default instances in order to determine 
whether it can be a simulation for the real-world financial risk 
assessment. 

--- Page 3 ---
B. Data Collection 
The "Bank Indessa" dataset in Kaggle is being used for this 
research. It contains 45 features regarding attributes of 
borrowers and loan details [1]. Essential data belonging to 
loan amounts, interest rates, borrower demographics, and 
credit history among others have to be accounted for in loan 
default prediction. It captures most of the major factors 
influencing loan repayment. Data cleaning was also 
performed, addressing missing values and outliers as 
recommended by Mohita [14]. 
C. Data Preprocessing 
Missing Values: 
A heatmap identified missing data patterns. For numerical 
features, missing values were imputed with the mean, and for 
categorical features, with the mode. 
‚óè 
Equation: For a numerical feature X with missing 
values:

where n represents the number of values that are not 
missing.

ùê∂‡Øú‡Ø†‡Ø£‡Ø®‡Øß‡Øò‡Øó= ùëÄùëúùëëùëí(ùê∂) 
(2) 
Categorical Variable Encoding 
Categorical 
variables 
were 
integer 
encoded 
using 
LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing, converting them 
into numerical representations for model interpretation. For 
example, the variable 'grade' with categories {A, B, C} was 
transformed into {0, 1, 2}.. 
Feature Engineering 
New features were created to improve model performance, 
including significant ratios like balance-to-credit and 
recoveries-to-balance [9][15][11]. Key features included 
Total Payment (total_payment), Income to Loan Ratio 
(income_to_loan_ratio), DTI Revol Util (dti_revol_util), and 
Balance to Credit Ratio (balance_to_credit_ratio). 
Splitting the Dataset 
The dataset was divided into training and validation sets in 
an 80-20 proportion, utilising the train_test_split function 
from sklearn.model_selection to assess model performance 
on previously unseen data. 
D. Model Development 
Four models were developed: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, 
Gradient 
Boosting, 
and 
Random 
Forest. 
The 
hyperparameters used for training each model are listed in 
Table 1. The performances were assessed over recall, 
accuracy, F1 score, and precision, following credit risk 
modelling methodologies [2][16][17]. 
1. Logistic Regression: Estimates the probability of binary 
outcomes like loan defaults. It uses the model equation 
 
ùíë=

where ùëß= ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1ùëã1 + ùõΩ2ùëã2+. . . . . . . +ùõΩ‡Ø°ùëã‡Ø° 
Training was conducted using maximum likelihood to find 
optimal coefficients. 
 
2. Random Forest: A decision tree-based ensemble approach 
designed to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting by 
averaging the results of multiple trees. Feature importance is 
determined by how much each feature enhances node purity 
[12].

ùë¶‡∑ú(‡Øú) 
(4) 
 
3. Gradient Boosting: Constructs models in a sequence, with 
each subsequent model addressing the mistakes made by its 
predecessors. The framework is: 
 
 
ùêπ‡Ø†(ùëã) = ùêπ‡Ø†‡¨ø1(ùëã) + ùõæ‡Ø†‚Ñé‡Ø†(ùëã) 
(5) 
Where ùêπ‡Ø†(ùëã) is the final model and ùõæ‡Ø†‚Ñé‡Ø† represents each 
subsequent learner.[8] 
 
4. XGBoost: An optimised version of Gradient Boosting, 
known for its efficiency with large datasets. It minimises a 
regularised loss function to prevent overfitting, formulated 
as: 
 
ùëÇùëèùëóùëíùëêùë°ùëñùë£ùëí= ‚àë‡Øá

(6)  
[18][16]. 
E. Evaluation Metrics 

--- Page 4 ---
Several metrics were used to evaluate the models, with 
accuracy being the primary one. It provided insights into how 
well each model predicted loan-defaults, facilitating 
between-model comparisons. The objective was to determine 
which method offered the most reliable prediction of loan-
default probabilities. 
 
IV. Result 
A. Data Analysis 
Key features for predicting loan-default included amount 
borrowed, total amount paid, income-to-loan ratio, and debt-
to-income ratio. Borrower characteristics like length of 
employment and total recovery were also significant. Feature 
engineering, such as creating new variables like balance-to-
credit and recoveries-to-balance ratios, enhanced the ability 
to distinguish between borrowers likely and unlikely to 
default[4][19][20].

Section E. 
C. Visualisation of Model Performance 
For this, confusion matrices, correlation heatmap (See Fig. 
3), and feature importance ranking plots (See Fig. 4) are 
drawn. From these plots, it was clear that XGBoost 
performed better in relation to the best compromise of 
precision, recall, and generalisation, compared to that of 
random forests; therefore, it was the best model for this 
task[6][23][22]. 
D. Interpretation of Results 
1. Performance Comparison 
‚óè 
Logistic Regression, serving as the baseline, 
underperformed relative to ensemble methods. 
Random Forest and XGBoost showed superior 
accuracy and F1 scores (See Fig. 5), with XGBoost 
excelling due to its advanced boosting and 
regularisation techniques [8][18]. 
2. Feature Importance 
‚óè 
Random Forest and XGBoost identified 
income_to_loan_ratio, balance_to_credit_ratio, and 
total_recovery as crucial for predicting defaults, 
with both methods highlighting these features 
consistently [9][15][16]. 
3. Correlation Analysis 
‚óè 
The heatmap revealed strong correlations among 
engineered features like income_to_loan_ratio and 
balance_to_credit_ratio, 
confirming 
their 
significance. Multicollinearity was managed using 
the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to maintain 
model accuracy [2][13][14]. 
4. Model Limitations and Future Work 
‚óè 
Models faced challenges with class imbalance and 
data noise. SMOTE was used to address the 
imbalance (See Fig. 6), and future research should 
consider ensemble stacking and deep learning

V. Conclusion 
In summary, this research centred on forecasting loan-
defaults by employing multiple machine learning algorithms, 
such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, 
and Random Forest. XGBoost emerged as the most effective 
model, demonstrating superior predictive performance due to 
advanced ensemble methods and feature engineering. 
The findings suggest that XGBoost can significantly enhance 
predictions for loan defaults, aiding financial institutions in 
risk management and decision-making. However, issues like 
overfitting and class imbalance highlight the need for further 
refinement, potentially through ensemble stacking or deep 
learning. Overall, this research provides valuable insights
